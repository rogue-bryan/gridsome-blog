This is my web page. I've recently been playing around with different static site generators. My original trial run was using [react-static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static). While using it, I found out how to dig in and write documents and content using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). I even started to write some blog posts about it!

All that work was a bit before my tenure at my current client, where we started using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and I kinda fell in love with the syntax and component setup. I started searching (using google) for a different generator and found [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)!
